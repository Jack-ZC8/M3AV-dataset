Friends and colleagues, as well as meeting new people, and the Niddk in particular, and nih are such spectacular. places, it's really great to see the breadth and depth of research here. And although I'll only talk about, I'll try to be relatively focused, I'll start with some background that will hopefully hit on it interests and areas of interest to a number of people in the in the crowd. But I thought I'd start with with this because this reminds us of really what we are trying to understand. We're trying to understand. what obesity, what causes obesity, and then what its, how it causes its morbidity and mortality that it's associated with, and then what to do about those things. And one of the major things that we think about, we think about the morbidity associated with obesity, can be boiled down to this Notion of the metabolic syndrome, Jerry Reeven, one of my mentors at Stanford is the person who pioneered the concept of syndrome X. And I think that in from his point of view, and and this is an interesting topic we could discuss, this is really. insulin resistance, which otherwise is sort of one of the criteria that gets you into the syndrome of metabolic syndrome. He would, to this day, argue that this is an insulin resistance syndrome, and that it's actually insulin resistance that's driving all the other bullet points on here. But as the metabolic syndrome has been defined, it includes this, this metabolic parameters of central obesity, high blood pressure, high triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol, and insulin resistance, all of which Are risk factors for cardiovascular disease, and of course, insulin resistance is sine qua non. of type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes also is epidemic, like obesity, and the leading cause of death from type 2 diabetes is cardiovascular disease, macrovascular complications associated with insulin resistance, as well as these other factors, whether or not they are caused by the insulin resistance or part of this constellation. What I'm largely going to focus on today, to keep a particular focus of the talk, is another aspect of the metabolic syndrome that's only, I would say, relatively recently recognized as more than just a curiosity, and that's the fatty liver.",

And the problem can be considered, as on the slide, where the fatty liver can become inflamed and lead to so-called non-alcoholic steatohepatitis that can lead to fibrosis, which can lead to cirrhosis. And indeed, Fatty liver and liver disease associated with fatty liver is increasingly becoming a cause for a concern. and the cirrhosis caused by it is one of the leading causes. I believe it's now second to alcoholic liver disease. Worldwide, of course, hepatitis C Is up high on the list, and of course, cirrhosis is a precursor of pancellular carcinoma. And we now realize that obesity is a major risk factor for many many types of cancer, and one of the leading ones is liver cancer. So the role of.

But of course, if it was this easy, I wouldn't be telling you about this story. The other part point I want to bring in as part of the introduction is the increasing increase, how increasingly clear it is. that circadian rhythms play a role in metabolism, which we've known for a long time. All endocrinologists recognize that most endocrine systems Obey a circadian pattern, but that actually they contribute to the dysmetabolism of metabolic syndrome, and and some of the issues our society is dealing with. Just to run through the some of the many aspects of interrelationship between circadian rhythm and metabolism. many hormones have circadian rhythms.

And here what you're looking at is mice, either wild type mice or OB-OB, genetically morbidly obese mice, which are on the upper part of the curve, of the graph here, and I'll really focus on the lower part, but they're really, the OB-OB is an exaggeration, the fat mice are an exaggeration. And also embedded on this slide, and this is the article it comes from, is adipose tissue, which is similar to liver in this regard, but since I'm going to focus on liver, I'm just going to show you the liver data here, and what you can see is that when the mice normal Mice are, in this case, are in the in the dark, so they're active and feeding.

Or, or lipogenesis, so de novo lipogenesis, fatty acid synthesis by the liver has a circadian rhythm that we've known about for a long time. but the mechanism underlying this phenomenon has not been established, and I'm going to suggest one for you in this lecture. And then, to introduce the players that I'd like to suggest are involved, which are the nuclear receptors, I want to just bring up the whole notion of whether this is related to genes or environment, and when you look at people like this, who probably have metabolic syndrome but certainly are obese and are genetically identical, We actually know from the work of Mickey Stunkert at University of Pennsylvania and many others identical twin studies. twins reared apart. showing that there's a tremendous concordance in obesity, as well as in type 2 diabetes in identical twins, so it's clearly a genetic component, and yet the obesity and diabetes epidemic that we are so aware of that really became obvious in the 50s and have accelerated to the 70s, the 80s, the 90s, and show no sign of slowing down in this millennium, These epidemics occurred during a time when the environment changed dramatically.

    "speech_text": "component, and I think that I'm sure many in the audience are already thinking this way, but it's the science of epigenomics that rather than having people get into fights at cocktail parties about whether it's the genes or the environment, I think epigenomics are what link the environment to gene expression. And here I'm talking about chromatin modifications, could be DNA methylation or histone modification that result in changes in gene expression and function without a corresponding alteration in DNA sequence. Notice I'm not, in my definition of epigenomics, saying anything about heritability. In the epigenetics community, in the epigenetics world, because of the U term or the part of the term genetics, I think it's reasonable to consider and. and as many do, require heritability, whether it's from mother to progeny or from mother cell to daughter cell, Require heritability of the change, epigenomics and the epigenome to In, In this definition really refers to the way that the. Genome, which is more or less the same in every cell, except for very specialized cells, of course, is, is configured in the nucleus. And that involves the nucleosomes with the histone octomer and these histone tails which get modified. and it's really those modifications that I'll particularly function on, focus on. And the reason that this is how the environment can interact in the genome is that things in the environment interact and impact and change the epigenome. And I'm dividing here the environment into the internal environment and the external environment. The internal environment, in part, as a homage to Claude Bernard, the famous and first, famous French endocrinologist, and really first endocrinologist, Who postulated the role of hormones and metabolites in regulating the internal milieu, the internal environment the same time? the external environment is particularly notable for the diet, down up north where I come from, in Philadelphia, this is the The great stuff that we love to eat, and which is contributing to the problem, but of course it also contributes nutrients and vitamins you can't. completely go without a diet.

I've been studying since I was a postdoc with Bill Chin in the eighties, and in my own lab at Penn for for 22 years. There are many fantastic groups here at Nih, who are also interested in nuclear receptors, can be thought of in one sense, and I ll propose to you that they are. really transducers of environmental signals into changes in gene expression, yes, but through epigenomic change. So the model for nuclear receptors is that they are these transcription factors that bind to small molecules to regulate gene expression, and these small molecules are invariably derived from the environment. The internal environment and the hormones and metabolites is where the nuclear receptors, which were originally known as the nuclear hormone receptors because the first modulators discovered were the thyroid hormones, steroid hormones, glucocorticoids, estrogen, sex steroids, and so forth, as well as metabolites, including, more recently, metabolites such as fatty acids and oxysterols. And the external environment is also sensed by a subset of nuclear receptors. For example, the fat-soluble vitamins, vitamin A and vitamin D, get converted into nuclear receptor ligands. The retinoic acid receptor is the target of retinoids and the vitamin D receptor, of course, of vitamin D. And there's a fascinating subject of xenobiotics. Frank Gonzalez here is really the leader, one of the leaders in this area, in which the nuclear receptors are, a subset of nuclear receptors are sensing, in a In a very primitive immune defense way, if you will, drugs, or so called xenobiotics, non natural compounds. That are sensed by the nuclear receptors that then drive the the transcription and synthesis of the p450 system in the liver that detoxifies these chemicals. So that's something, I'm sure, Frank has talked about here many times. Here it just makes the point, in my argument, that the family as a whole has, potentially, has in common this role of responding to the environment. So what do they do while they regulate transcription? they do so by binding to a whole set of genes, And I like to use the term systrome partly because of. The Omics era, but also because of this term that was coined by Miles Brown. Allow it its substitutes for saying all of the binding sites in the genome occupied by factor X. You",

That we're trying to understand how nuclear receptors work, and led to the discovery of the Co, repressors, in particular, Encore and smart, and then. Almost immediately, that's that was the era many in the audience probably remember when we were 1st, starting to realize how important protein protein interactions were. and the first thing people did was to take either pieces of these molecules or the whole molecule and look for potential interactions in things like yeast two hybrid screens, which were extremely valuable, led to some great insights, but also led to a lot of false positives, if you will, and we went very quickly, because these actually are very large molecules, about 2,500 amino acids each, went from a short period of time where there was no clue what they did to having hundreds of molecules they could potentially interact with, And what, Matt Gunther? when he was a graduate student in my laboratory. This is really our lab's version of slugging through how there is how the Co repressor. interacts with the nuclear receptor through these corner peptides, and then the complex, and that's what you'll find in this compendium of papers, but it was really Matt Gunther's work that I'm going to highlight now, and what Matt did was to purify the complex of SMART, one of these two co-repressor proteins from HeLa cells, the endogenous complex, and what he found was a very tight Complex, we refer to as the core complex that contains a number, a couple of interesting molecules, I'm not going to go into in detail, but contained a single histone, deacetylase, and specifically. Histone deacetylase, three in stoichiometric abundance, and we got interested in that because as I've already mentioned, this is a regulator. of epigenomic structure and potentially of gene expression, and the other thing that Matt discovered, which really surprised us because we've been thinking all along, and I think it's largely true, That these docking proteins, the the Co oppressors largely serve as docking proteins that deliver these enzymes and other interesting and important molecules to targeted sites in the genome.

So we took advantage of this by starting Starting to study what happens if Ncore cannot interact with Hdac Three, this is the work of notably two people in the lab, Takehiro. Taka hero Ishizuka, who did all of the in vitro biochemistry and cell culture work, and then Teresa Allengard. Who courageously knocked in the mutation that Takihiro had found to abrogate the binding activation of H Deck Three? Into C57 Black Six mice, so we could understand the in vivo importance of this protein protein partnership. So what Takehiro found? Was a point mutation in that Sant motif within this domain that we call the deacetylase activating domain? Is sufficient not only to block Hdac three interaction, which I'm not even showing you on this slide. but actually now we're looking here at the histone deacetylase enzyme activity of an immunocomplex containing wild type NCORE And this point mutant expressed at equal amounts in these experiments, not shown here. And you can see that there's almost baseline amounts of Hdac activity suggesting. That not only is this point mutation not binding Hdac three, but that Hdac three is by far the most quantitatively important histone deacetylase. in this complex. So Teresa went ahead and made mice. It was very important for us to do so because the encore null mutation is embryonically lethal, shown by Jeff Rosenfeld's colleague and colleagues. and these mice in the C57 black six background were born in normal Mendelian ratios and they looked completely normal. And what that told us was that since Ncore, as I just told you, is required for life, and so is Hdac Three, as we've shown, and Scott Hebert and Eric Olson have shown. They're all both required That says that it's complicated and that there's other partnerships. E.g. we know that Hdac Three can interact with smart. And we know that Ncor has other domains, and in this experiment it must be that these other domains of Ncor that are conserves across species. Are what are critical for the survival in the mutant mice? The Ncor is expressed at normal levels, but doesn't interact with Hdac three.

Well, what she found in this experiment where she took out the interaction specifically between Ncore and Hdac three? Were changes in biological rhythms as well as glucose and lipid metabolism the biological? The change in the in the biological rhythm was a change in the. Free running period, the behavioral activity, that is the the inherent circadian clock of these these mice. And the reason that we even thought to look at that is because a couple of years before Uli Schibler and his colleagues in Geneva. Had implicated reverb and I, I don't know how well you can see it, but this is a reverb here. This is taken from a review article by Joe Takahashi, That reverb is one of two. I'm not only showing one negative limb in the circadian clock, and very briefly the circadian clock. The transcriptional circadian clock involves a positive. Limb, led by Bmol One, which is a Bhlh protein, forming a heterodimer with Clock and regulating in a positive way the gene expression. Of the of many genes that we think of as being regulated in a circadian matter, in you name the tissue, and especially in suprachisematic nucleus of the hype of.

The Bmol promoter was something that lay in in my lab had demonstrated, and reverb is perfect for this because. It's a nuclear receptor that we've been studying for for quite some time, and it lacks Ac terminus that again, the nuclear receptor Cognoscenti will know is critical for. Activation of transcription by ligand reverb is lacking that it's a constitutive repressor, but binds Ncor.

Decided to do, and this is largely the work of Dan Feng, in the laboratory, graduate student is to determine the cistrome of Hdac three in the liver. Again, all the binding sites of Hdac three in the liver, and this technology, I think is shrewdly well known here. The work of Casey Zhao, with many histone modifying enzymes, Gordon Hager, Who's who's who's, pioneered not only even to the nuclear receptor. chip assays, but also hypersensitivity type assays and so on, which use similar technologies. But for those who have not seen this before, In the beauty of this is, you can look at the endogenous molecules and their endogenous setting with the natural genome of the tissue or cells that you're interested in. Here we're using the mouse liver. And the idea is that you chop up the DNA in one way or the other, you immunoprecipitate it with a specific antibody, and then what many laboratories do is interrogate very specific regions of the genome by something that can be called chromatin IP chip PCR where either semi-quantitatively or quantitatively, using location-specific primers, you interrogate the gene of interest and you basically figure out if your factor was there or not. Well with the advent of deep sequencing, we can now do what's called ChIP-seq. And in this case, instead of doing this biased analysis and looking at the only the sites you're interested in, you can look genome wide. And that's why this is potentially called cistromics. and. this requires, you know, cheap deep sequencing, which is now possible, not as cheap as we like, but it's getting there, and really outstanding bioinformatics.

Even though it was surprising to us to see such a great attenuation of the signal at 5 a.m., the most obvious explanation was that reverb was more important than we ever imagined it would be For bringing Hdac three to genes in the liver, To address this, we did the following 1st. We looked bioinformatically. under those 15,000 HDAC3 peaks, and we saw the half site, which we know is the nuclear receptor half site. Secondly, we performed ChIP-seq analysis for reverb, and what we found was a remarkable overlap such that about 90 percent of the HDAC3 binding sites overlapped right on top, and I'll show you in a minute an example of this, right on top of the reverb binding sites. And finally, using reverb knockout mice that we obtained from Bjorn Vennstrom in Stockholm, but then bred to. Ten generations on black, six mice to be comparable with all the other experiments. Basically what we find and what is summarized in this blue box here, but for all sorts of genes, including Bmal. is that we lose the, largely lose the rhythm that we see between 5 p.m. and 5 a.m., suggesting that indeed it is reverb That's recruiting Hdac three to the majority of these sites.

Maybe she's just not on her game at 05:00 a.m. like she was at 05:00 p.m. But you can see that it's the same samples and it's another chip. It's another antibody, but it's basically a chip experiment. And you can see there's a signal here and not here. So it's that's not it. It's really a true biological result, okay? so finally, as I alluded to, we want to know what the function of this all is. We're interested in the mechanism. We want to deconvolute this in terms of what factor is",
