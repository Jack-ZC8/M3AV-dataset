    "speech_text": "So, good afternoon everybody and welcome to the Wednesday afternoon lecture series. My name is Bob Colbert and it's a distinct pleasure for me to be able to introduce today's speaker who is Jenny Ting. Dr. Ting is the William Keenan Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where she directs the Center for Translational Immunology and is co-director of the Inflammatory Diseases Institute also at UNC. I first got to know Jenny about 20 or almost 25 years ago when we co-taught an immunology lab for medical students at the University of North Carolina. You can tell that's a long time ago because I said immunology lab and medical students in the same sentence. So, we also share a little bit of a common academic ancestry because we both did post-doctoral work with Jeff Frelinger, although at different times. But let me just say a few things about Jenny, and and some of the major contributions that she's made to immunology. She has a very long track record of really outstanding work contributing to our overall understanding of immune regulation. In the early 90s, she discovered how C2TA, which is the MHC class 2 transactivator Known to be mutated in and causative baro lymphocyte syndrome, How this mediates cytokine induction of class two expression. And which is critically important for adaptive immunity? I think what's really interesting is that it was her interest in. In C, two ta, and the recognition that mutants in proteins that had a similar domain structure. Actually caused inflammatory disorders that led her to look for genes with a similar domain structure and. that resulted in the discovery of a large multi-gene family, I think 22 members to date, at least in humans, that we now know as the Nod-like receptors or genes that encode the Nod-like receptors or NLRs. So, Many Nlr's are intracellular pattern recognition receptors involved in initiating or and or regulating. the innate immune response to danger signals created during cellular injury or toxins or invasion by microorganisms. And of course, we know that mutations in various NLRs, such as NLRP3, cause a variety of systemic inflammatory diseases, such as the cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes or CAPS. So, while many of these diseases are relatively rare, unless you work at the Nih, they really are can be quite devastating diseases. And they really highlight the importance of these genes to fundamental biological and immunological processes. And this has all become increasingly apparent over the last decade, and it seems to be growing almost on a daily basis. So what we're going to hear about today is how NLRs regulate diverse cell death responses, such as apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy, as well as diverse signaling pathways, including pathways involving NF-kappa-B and MAP-Ks. So Dr. Ting will present evidence for the broad biological and clinical impact of the NLR family of genes. So, Jenny, welcome. Thank you for coming. And I want to mention that there will be a reception immediately following her talk in the library. Is this on? I just want to thank you so much, Bob, for inviting me, and thank all the people for coming, despite the weather report. So what I'd like to tell you today is some of the things that we've been doing recently. And I just want to say that I've known Bob for 25 years, and at that time I was about ten years old and Bob was about six, so so we're not as old as we look.",

The first one, of course, was toll-like receptor, C-type lectins. We now know there are RNA sensors, such as re-glycolic cases. There are a bunch of DNA sensors listed here, and this is where our protein belong, a family of proteins belong. And these have at least two names. One is the name of MBDLR, which stands for nucleotide binding domain, losing rich repeat. And the other is non-like receptors, which stands for nucleotide oligomerization and dimerization domain receptors. And to be honest, I actually prefer the MBDLR, which is a name that 22 of us proposed years ago, and the reason is because we really don't know how these function. And this is one of the leading issues that I will discuss in this talk. And so we don't know if these are truly receptors, They might be or might not be. And, but they impact a lot of things, including inflammation, infectious diseases.",

    "speech_text": "cancer, et cetera. The way we came into this, I see Dina in the crowd, and both of us have worked a long time as colleagues and friends on this molecule, C2TA. It was discovered by Victor Steinle in Bernard Mock's lab, and most of us who are studying MHC jumped on it when this protein was discovered, because it is the protein that's mutated in a disease that cannot express class II MHC, and this is a class II transactivator. And we found that it has a functional ATP binding domain called nucleotide binding domain, and also it has a leucine-rich repeat that's functional as well. So by combining these two, we worked for a long time on C2TA, as have others, looking at all its different function, and at the end, I'll come back to this protein. But it's a transcription coactivator, so it recognizes DNA through DNA binding proteins, and then activates transcription. But two people in my lab, John Hartin and Mike Lindhoff, decided that this is such an important protein, because you can pop it on any cell, and they will express class II MHC, which is pretty remarkable. And they used these two domains and searched the human genome before the human genome was published, and came up with 22 genes. And then we named it Caterpillar for a long reason, I won't tell you about it, but now it's renamed either MBDLR or Nod-like receptors. And from that, the 22 genes, that's it. There's no more. If you search and search, you cannot find any more. That's the end of the story. So I always joke with my TLR colleague, unlike TLR, which there's trickles of TLRs that came out, there's only these many",

    "speech_text": "a little bit. So thinking about the NLR family, I just want to summarize, because most people think about the NLRs, they only think about the inflammasome. And that's actually not the case. And inflammasome, I'll explain it to you in just a little bit. So we started because C2TA is a transcription co-activator that leads to class II MHC gene regulation, which is the major histocompatibility complex. And more recently, it was found that NLRC5 is a master regulator of class I MHC genes, and mostly lymphocytes. And so these two are transcriptional regulators. And this is, again, the reason why I prefer the term NBDLR, because it doesn't look like that these two are RNAs or are typical PAMP receptors. So they're really not considered as PAMP receptor. And I think this point is very important, what we call things, because if we call something a specific term, then we have preconceived notion about what they should do. But in the field of NLR, I think we're still struggling in terms of trying to understand what they all do. The other one, as far as this inflammasome, and I will tell you more about this, but basically this is a complex formation that leads to the processing of IL-1 and IL-18 from their premature form into their mature form due to activation of caspase-1. And I'll explain a lot more about this. But now we have at least nine NLRs that have exhibited this function in at least one paper. So there are seven of these. I'm sorry, nine of these. And then the group that I'll concentrate on the most at the last part of the talk is regulators of NF-kappa-B myokinases or interferon. And I will focus my talk really on the interferon signature that's related to these NLR protein. Of course, interferon is really important for a lot of inflammatory diseases and genetic diseases. And today I heard more and more about that. And these are several NLRs are in that pathway. And another one I wish I had time to tell you a lot more about. I know there's a lot of interest here. Many of these NLRs are also causes of cell death, necrosis, and autophagy. And remember that NLR actually are found from plants to humans. And they're preserved all the way in plants. But they also look like apoptotic protease activating factor APAP-1, which makes sense in terms of the role in cell death. So this is an overall",

    "speech_text": "of course, we and others have done a lot of work on. But the last protein which Function was elucidated is Nlrc Five, and many of us have done a lot of experiments to try to figure out what does this is protein do. And a young faculty who's now at Harvard, Kobayashi, was the first person who had a clue about what it might be doing and maybe doing other things. But the most prominent function is that it regulates class 1 MHC. And it looks like it also binds to, it can be found by chip assays, a chromatin IP assay, to be located to the class 1 MHC promoter. And this is what we did. So we made a knockout and we look at class 1 genes, class 1 MHC, including H2K. Beta 2M is an adapter molecule of H2K. TLA is a non-classical class 1 molecule. And in every case, if you knock out NLRC5, there's very little class 1 expression on B cells, T cells, or NK cells. And this is true for H2K, for Beta H2k for Beta two M, as well as Tla, However, it has no function on class two Mhc gene regulation, as shown here. nor does it have any effect on CD1, which is not encoded by the MHC domain. So this shows that this is maybe a master regulator of these two, of these three genes. And other people have similar data. And just to show you that we made a knockout of C2TA a long time ago, and NLRC5 right here. And in NLRC5 knockout mouse, there's reduced class 1, and C2TA, there's no reduction of class 1. And if you look over here, however, there's C2TA knockouts have reduced class 2. In fact, class 2 is almost gone, but NLRC5 knockout mice have no reduction of class 2. So it's reciprocal in that these two proteins regulate class 1 and class 2 reciprocally. So when you think about how a protein wants to regulate adaptive immune response, I can't think of a better pathway for them to regulate, which is both class 1 and class 2. So this changes the entire landscape for the",

And of course, this has received a ton of attention, but I again want to emphasize, inflammasome is just a subgroup of NLRs. There are NLRs that do not have any inflammasome functions. And the reason we came to this is the the work of several rheumatologists, Dan Kassner and his colleague Iwona. and Raphael Golbach-Mansky, of course, are really giants in the field. And Hal Hoffman was the first person who realized the connection of this family of diseases with this gene called NLRP3, initially called cryopyrin, because it was found in patients who have an inflammatory response to a drop in temperature. So Hal Hoffman called this the cryopyrin protein. In Europe, Michael McDermott was really doing many of the same things in the translational immunology. So it was found that mutations in this protein that initially was called cryopyrin resulted in a lot of skin rashes, Arthralgia stiffness, and there's many three different diseases that are linked to this with a gradation of severity, and there's. more than 80 mutations now, I think, in this gene that's related to inflammatory response. One of the triumphs of the field is that they found out that IL-1 is increased in these patients, and you can treat these patients with an IL-1 receptor antagonist called Anacara, and within a day, they all got better. So that's really a remarkable triumph of what these groups have done, including, of course, the giants of the",

And we now know that what you really want at the end is processing of pro-IL-1 and pro-IL-18 into their mature form, and that's what the inflammasome concept is. But you have two signals that are required in many cell types, but not all cell types. Some cell types already have signal one that's activated. So these signals can be TLRs or TNF receptor, and Alan Shear has beautiful work to show that CARD9 is also very important for the first step of inducing pro-IL-1 production. And we showed a long time ago that LPS induces NLRP3 induction in IL-18. So you have to have these to be transcriptionally induced and translationally induced, but this is not enough. You need signal two, and signal two, I always joke with the people in the inflammasome field, basically you look at the cells wrong and they have signal two. So this could be DAMPS, of course, that's the work, very early and prophetic work of Pauli Matsinger at NIH, That there's damage and associated or danger, associated, molecular patterns and pamps, and many other toxins and dinucleotides Er. stress, MAFs protein from the work of Ron Germain, salt, osmolality, et cetera, can induce a number of factors. We don't know how common all of these are. There's debates about how each one is important, and some would argue that potassium efflux is the most important factor. Other, many of us have also seen mitochondrial ros upstream of inflammasome, activation, calcium, mitochondrial Dna release, et Cetera, and. And you have negative regulators as well, And these, really what they're doing is leading to the. complex formation of this inflammasome complex, comprising of NLR protein, indicated here as NLRP3, adapter molecule ASC, and PROCASPASE-1. And what all these things do is cause the assembly of this into a multimeric complex such as this, and it's predicted to have about six or seven copies of each one of these based on some EM, cryo-EM studies. And this complex then leads to the proteolytic, I'm sorry, proximal activation of PROCASPASE-1 into CASPASE-1, which then cleaves IL-1 beta and IL-18 to their mature forms. So this whole concept is the inflammasome. And again, for those of you who work with human cells, I just want to say, human monocytes actually do not require SIGNL1,",

So anthrax is very important, and that's, again, is based on much of the work done here at NIH. And intracellular, more recently it's found by Vishwa Dixit that there's an alternative non-canonical inflammasome that actually activates CASPASE-11, and that's through intracellular LPS. So LPS can activate this. We don't know all the pathways that leads to this. And there's also DSS colitis can activate NLRP6. Again, it's not entirely clear what activates this, but probably microbiome changes.

It's encoded on human on chromosome 16, and we showed in a nature immunology paper published over a year ago that if we overexpress NLRC3, we have a reduction of TNF as well as IL-6 response in response to LPS. So we think there's a link between the TLR pathway and NLR pathway. If we do a shRNA knocking down NLRC3, we see increased transcription of these genes, suggesting that it is an inhibitor of transcription of these genes. So then the mechanism we tried to look at is mechanism, and we narrowed it down to a trap, and we found NLRC3 can interact with trap during LPS treatment, and this is shown here, which we showed that NLRC3 interacts with trap. If we mutate a trap binding site, we knock down this interaction. And through many different studies, we were able to show that in NLRC3 knockout mice cells, there's a reduction in the activating ubiquination of TRAP6, and TRAP6 is activated by the K63 ubiquination of TRAP6. And in NLR knockout mice, there's increased activation of this K63 ubiquination. So this would lead to TRAP6 activation. So to summarize, we think what happens is NLRC3 interacts with TRAP6 to prevent it normally from being activated by ubiquination. If we remove NLRC3, we now have enhanced K63 ubiquination.",

    "speech_text": "So at this point these two clues were enough to make us think about a specific pathway. that has gained a lot of attention, especially last year, and that's the STING pathway. The STING pathway, Many, there's many studies trying to figure out what are the pathways that are important for Dna sensing by intracellular molecules. And the sting has become the major central adapter of many big different pathways, so. DNA can feed in, for example, into IFI-16 or P200. This feeds into STING pathway. DNA can be converted by polymerase III, go through RIG-I and MAFs, activate the STING pathway. DAI goes through the STING pathway. But it's one of the things about sting is it activates Tbk, One activates in Irf Three and Nf Kappa B to induce interferon. So this is the central molecule that's a central dicyclic nucleotide sensing molecule because it's been crystallized and found to bind to cyclic dinucleotide. But also the laboratory of Glenn Barber has found that this can bind directly to DNA. So this can either sense DNA or cyclic dinucleotide, activating TBK. So we wanted to see if NRC3 can be placed in this",

That's because it acts over here, and so if you have Irf three activation. it's too high. It cannot affect downstream IRF3.

But NRC3 can also co-precipitate with endogenous TBK1. And we did a lot of mapping, and like I said, this paper is not published but soon to be published in Immunity, and we were able to show that the fragment that NRC3 interacts with in STING and TBK are exactly the same domain that these two molecules use to interact with one another.

And the reverse direction, we were able to show that if we precipitate NRC3, it also co-precipitated STING. So I think this pretty clearly shows that STING can interact with NRC3. Then the question is, what is the functional consequence of this? We know one of the functional consequences of STING activation is TBK. Remember I showed you TBK is downstream of STING, and TBK is the Taq kinase, which is an NFKP activating kinase. And if you activate STING, you can see TBK phosphorylation indicated here. So this is wild-type cells activated with double-stranded DNA, and TBK is not that much phosphorylated until six hours after treatment. If we look at NLRP3 knockout cells, we see increased TBK phosphorylation very early on, so there's a kinetic switch to a very early time point of TBK phosphorylation.",

And we showed if we overexpress Nlrp Three, However, the perinuclear experience appearance this almost disappeared from. 10 %, about to 1 %, and we cannot find any cells with this punctated appearance, so it changed the localization of sting.

And you can see that wild-type, we can see it up to here, but there's more STING that's co-localized with the TBK column in non-treated cells in NLRP3 knockouts. But if we treat these cells, infect these cells with HSV, there's a more dramatic co-localization of STING in the knockout cells, and this is TBK and this is STING, so there's more co-localization of these bands in the knockout cells than in the wild-type cells. To quantitate this, we quantitated it based on the first fraction, and did it as a ratio of the first fraction. And it's probably clear as here, which is the HSV-treated cells, and these are looking at fractions that contain both TBK and STING. And so you can see in the knockouts, we have a lot more fractions that contain fractions with both TBK and STING.

We have NLR proteins that act as inflammasome. We have NLR proteins that change interferon in MITOG. And also there are some that changes NF-kappa-B and so forth. So how do we have an overall picture of this? I'm not sure I can introduce an overall picture, but I can think of some consensus in terms of what these might be doing. So I come to Nlrs and nucleic, acids, and going from here we know C, two ta based. based on the work of many, that the C2TA promoter is, of course, a DNA. It binds to DNA-binding proteins, and C2TA is found at the promoter by chromatin IP. So C2TA is very good at recognizing DNA, whether it's DNA protein complex or DNA. It's not entirely clear, but it certainly can recognize DNA. Our previous work with NLRX1 suggests that this molecule can interfere Can interfere with this pathway, which is Rna sensing by Rig I, which binds to. RNA molecule. And so this molecule can also be part of the RNA-sensing pathway. We now have evidence that NLRC3 can regulate this DNA-sensing pathway of STING and TBK. So in many of these cases, we're suggesting NLR may be connected to DNA and RNA. In innate immunity, we call this DNA and RNA-sensing. In transcription, we call this transcriptional activation. And I should just point out that there are papers showing that NLRP3 can recognize mitochondria DNA. So coming to a full picture, whether that's something we should all be thinking about, that is maybe there is an underlying rule, and it's connecting NLRs with nucleic",
