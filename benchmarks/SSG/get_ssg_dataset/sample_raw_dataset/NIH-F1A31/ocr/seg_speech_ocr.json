    "speech_text": "My name is Griffin Rodgers, I'm the director of the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases. and I'm delighted to welcome you here today to hear Dr. Mitchell Lazar To tell us about nuclear receptors and the epigenomic regulation of circadian rhythms and metabolism, Dr.. Lazar is a Sylvan Eisman Professor of Medicine and Genetics, the Chief of the Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, and the Director of the Institute for Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism at the University of Pennsylvania. Our guest speaker received his undergraduate degree in chemistry from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He then went on to receive his Ph.D. in neuroscience And his M D, both from Stanford University. He trained in internal medicine at the Brigham's and Women's Hospital in Boston. and did an endocrinology fellowship at the Massachusetts General before joining the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania in 1989. Research conducted by Dr. Lazar and his lab, particularly the study of thyroid hormone receptors, It has led to really a series of discoveries related to the mechanism of nuclear receptor mediated repression. In addition, his lab has been using genome-wide methodologies to better understand the effects of diet, obesity, and circadian rhythms on metabolism, as you'll hear today. It's getting increasingly difficult to to find a leading scientific journals to which Dr. Lazar hasn't. Contributed, in fact, I was just looking over this night, just the 1st three months of this year, Dr. Lazar's work has been published. in Science, Molecular Endocrinology, Diabetes, the Journal of Neuroscience, and the Journal of Immunology, just to name a few. Dr. Lazar has given named lectures throughout the world, and is a former member of our institute, Our Niddk's Council. Our advisory council, He's also been associate editor of Diabetes and is on the editorial board. of at least a half a dozen prestigious publications. In addition to NIH, many organizations have singled him out and recognize his seminal work and his outstanding achievement. These include the American Thyroid Association, the Endocrine Society and the American Society for a Clinical Investigation. I could go on and on about Dr. Lazar's accomplishments, but I suspect you, like me, would prefer to hear his presentation. For that, let me turn over the podium to Dr. Mitch Lazar.",

Friends and colleagues, as well as meeting new people, and the Niddk in particular, and nih are such spectacular. places, it's really great to see the breadth and depth of research here. And although I'll only talk about, I'll try to be relatively focused, I'll start with some background that will hopefully hit on it interests and areas of interest to a number of people in the in the crowd. But I thought I'd start with with this because this reminds us of really what we are trying to understand. We're trying to understand. what obesity, what causes obesity, and then what its, how it causes its morbidity and mortality that it's associated with, and then what to do about those things. And one of the major things that we think about, we think about the morbidity associated with obesity, can be boiled down to this Notion of the metabolic syndrome, Jerry Reeven, one of my mentors at Stanford is the person who pioneered the concept of syndrome X. And I think that in from his point of view, and and this is an interesting topic we could discuss, this is really. insulin resistance, which otherwise is sort of one of the criteria that gets you into the syndrome of metabolic syndrome. He would, to this day, argue that this is an insulin resistance syndrome, and that it's actually insulin resistance that's driving all the other bullet points on here. But as the metabolic syndrome has been defined, it includes this, this metabolic parameters of central obesity, high blood pressure, high triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol, and insulin resistance, all of which Are risk factors for cardiovascular disease, and of course, insulin resistance is sine qua non. of type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes also is epidemic, like obesity, and the leading cause of death from type 2 diabetes is cardiovascular disease, macrovascular complications associated with insulin resistance, as well as these other factors, whether or not they are caused by the insulin resistance or part of this constellation. What I'm largely going to focus on today, to keep a particular focus of the talk, is another aspect of the metabolic syndrome that's only, I would say, relatively recently recognized as more than just a curiosity, and that's the fatty liver. Not too long ago, although it was known that diabetics and obese patients had fatty livers, it was",

    "speech_text": "thought that it was really innocuous. But what is increasingly recognized is that the fatty liver is really a precursor of of a of a severe problem. And the problem can be considered, as on the slide, where the fatty liver can become inflamed and lead to so-called non-alcoholic steatohepatitis that can lead to fibrosis, which can lead to cirrhosis. And indeed, Fatty liver and liver disease associated with fatty liver is increasingly becoming a cause for a concern. and the cirrhosis caused by it is one of the leading causes. I believe it's now second to alcoholic liver disease. Worldwide, of course, hepatitis C Is up high on the list, and of course, cirrhosis is a precursor of pancellular carcinoma. And we now realize that obesity is a major risk factor for many many types of cancer, and one of the leading ones is liver cancer. So the role of. Or the effects of this dis metabolic situation on the liver is of increasing concern. Now, if we're only this easy, if you go on the internet, you can actually buy this stuff. It's called Metabolic Syndrome Fighter. I'm happy to see that one of the exciting things that Dr. Collins is is spearheading is interaction between the Fda and the Nih. And maybe the Fda will will play a role in products like this. Now, At least it says it may assist in overcoming insulin resistance with an asterisk. So it's it's. truth in advertising. But of course, if it was this easy, I wouldn't be telling you about this story. The other part point I want to bring in as part of the introduction is the increasing increase, how increasingly clear it is. that circadian rhythms play a role in metabolism, which we've known for a long time. All endocrinologists recognize that most endocrine systems Obey a circadian pattern, but that actually they contribute to the dysmetabolism of metabolic syndrome, and and some of the issues our society is dealing with. Just to run through the some of the many aspects of interrelationship between circadian rhythm and metabolism. many hormones have circadian rhythms. There are obvious links between circadian rhythms and metabolic physiology, In that, whether you're a nocturnal like a mouse or diurnal like a human, you tend to eat when you're awake, not when you're sleeping. Glucose and lipid metabolism both have circadian rhythms and several cardiovascular risk factors including. From thrombosis potential of the blood have circadian rhythms such that most myocardial infarctions occur early in the morning. So the sort of good news and bad news? as with any cyclic process, the good news is that we made it through the morning and you have about a 75 % lower risk. of having a heart attack as you did it earlier in the morning, but tomorrow is another day. Obese people, of course, have sleep disorders, and sleep deprivation and shift work are associated with metabolic disturbances, and that's something that I think, We always there were aspects of of life, people that you knew or or shift workers that you knew. Sometimes nurses in hospitals, e.g. who worked in the night shift. it was a sense that there were",

And here what you're looking at is mice, either wild type mice or OB-OB, genetically morbidly obese mice, which are on the upper part of the curve, of the graph here, and I'll really focus on the lower part, but they're really, the OB-OB is an exaggeration, the fat mice are an exaggeration. And also embedded on this slide, and this is the article it comes from, is adipose tissue, which is similar to liver in this regard, but since I'm going to focus on liver, I'm just going to show you the liver data here, and what you can see is that when the mice normal Mice are, in this case, are in the in the dark, so they're active and feeding. That's when they have their increase in fatty acid synthesis, or. Or, or lipogenesis, so de novo lipogenesis, fatty acid synthesis by the liver has a circadian rhythm that we've known about for a long time. but the mechanism underlying this phenomenon has not been established, and I'm going to suggest one for you in this lecture. And then, to introduce the players that I'd like to suggest are involved, which are the nuclear receptors, I want to just bring up the whole notion of whether this is related to genes or environment, and when you look at people like this, who probably have metabolic syndrome but certainly are obese and are genetically identical, We actually know from the work of Mickey Stunkert at University of Pennsylvania and many others identical twin studies. twins reared apart. showing that there's a tremendous concordance in obesity, as well as in type 2 diabetes in identical twins, so it's clearly a genetic component, and yet the obesity and diabetes epidemic that we are so aware of that really became obvious in the 50s and have accelerated to the 70s, the 80s, the 90s, and show no sign of slowing down in this millennium, These epidemics occurred during a time when the environment changed dramatically. There was a trip. got so much easier to get fast food, high caloric food at low cost, you could drive to work rather than walk, and the lifestyles all changed, and yet this time frame is too short to, for any meaningful genetic changes to explain the explosion of metabolic disease.

    "speech_text": "component, and I think that I'm sure many in the audience are already thinking this way, but it's the science of epigenomics that rather than having people get into fights at cocktail parties about whether it's the genes or the environment, I think epigenomics are what link the environment to gene expression. And here I'm talking about chromatin modifications, could be DNA methylation or histone modification that result in changes in gene expression and function without a corresponding alteration in DNA sequence. Notice I'm not, in my definition of epigenomics, saying anything about heritability. In the epigenetics community, in the epigenetics world, because of the U term or the part of the term genetics, I think it's reasonable to consider and. and as many do, require heritability, whether it's from mother to progeny or from mother cell to daughter cell, Require heritability of the change, epigenomics and the epigenome to In, In this definition really refers to the way that the. Genome, which is more or less the same in every cell, except for very specialized cells, of course, is, is configured in the nucleus. And that involves the nucleosomes with the histone octomer and these histone tails which get modified. and it's really those modifications that I'll particularly function on, focus on. And the reason that this is how the environment can interact in the genome is that things in the environment interact and impact and change the epigenome. And I'm dividing here the environment into the internal environment and the external environment. The internal environment, in part, as a homage to Claude Bernard, the famous and first, famous French endocrinologist, and really first endocrinologist, Who postulated the role of hormones and metabolites in regulating the internal milieu, the internal environment the same time? the external environment is particularly notable for the diet, down up north where I come from, in Philadelphia, this is the The great stuff that we love to eat, and which is contributing to the problem, but of course it also contributes nutrients and vitamins you can't. completely go without a diet.

    "speech_text": "and so forth. And so nuclear receptors, which we've been studying? I've been studying since I was a postdoc with Bill Chin in the eighties, and in my own lab at Penn for for 22 years. There are many fantastic groups here at Nih, who are also interested in nuclear receptors, can be thought of in one sense, and I ll propose to you that they are. really transducers of environmental signals into changes in gene expression, yes, but through epigenomic change. So the model for nuclear receptors is that they are these transcription factors that bind to small molecules to regulate gene expression, and these small molecules are invariably derived from the environment. The internal environment and the hormones and metabolites is where the nuclear receptors, which were originally known as the nuclear hormone receptors because the first modulators discovered were the thyroid hormones, steroid hormones, glucocorticoids, estrogen, sex steroids, and so forth, as well as metabolites, including, more recently, metabolites such as fatty acids and oxysterols. And the external environment is also sensed by a subset of nuclear receptors. For example, the fat-soluble vitamins, vitamin A and vitamin D, get converted into nuclear receptor ligands. The retinoic acid receptor is the target of retinoids and the vitamin D receptor, of course, of vitamin D. And there's a fascinating subject of xenobiotics. Frank Gonzalez here is really the leader, one of the leaders in this area, in which the nuclear receptors are, a subset of nuclear receptors are sensing, in a In a very primitive immune defense way, if you will, drugs, or so called xenobiotics, non natural compounds. That are sensed by the nuclear receptors that then drive the the transcription and synthesis of the p450 system in the liver that detoxifies these chemicals. So that's something, I'm sure, Frank has talked about here many times. Here it just makes the point, in my argument, that the family as a whole has, potentially, has in common this role of responding to the environment. So what do they do while they regulate transcription? they do so by binding to a whole set of genes, And I like to use the term systrome partly because of. The Omics era, but also because of this term that was coined by Miles Brown. Allow it its substitutes for saying all of the binding sites in the genome occupied by factor X. You could just say the systrome of factor X. so it's a useful term. Now, the nuclear receptors bind to these many sites in the genome, and I'll have more to say about that in a moment, and they recruit co-regulator molecules, and there are two flavors of these, lots of specifics, but the major ones are co-repressors that actually repress transcription In the absence of the ligand or co activators that activate transcription, and the act of in in the presence of the. Of the environmental, the derived signal, and they do so by acting as platforms that deliver many enzymes. Locally to these regions of the genome, and this, this is actually an incomplete list and I'd like to focus on. The most famous ones which are the histone deacetylases and the histone acetyltransferases that modulate the acetylation of. Lysine residues in the in the tails of the histone molecules making up the nucleosome and change the epigenomic structure in ways that. eventually leads to regulation of gene expression. So that's the link that I'm referring to here, and what I'd like to do in the rest of the talk is to start focusing sort of more and more intensely, And I'm going to start with the histone",

Inhibitors of the non sirtuin histone deacetylase inhibitors, though. really have formed the basis of so-called epigenetic therapy of a number of cancers, and I'm just showing you a list here. So in clinical use today are a number of molecules that have lots of other effects, and I really should emphasize that, and make them up at the question and answer period, But what they have in common is that they inhibit histone deacetylases and the acetylaces, that, especially the class I, and often the class Ii. And I'm going to focus on a particular class one astoni acetylates called Hdac Three, and at this point. posit to you that not all the HDACs are created equal, and I'm going to really focus on HDAC3 because we think it tells us a lot per se, and I hope you'll find the story interesting, But I also think it's paradigmatic for how we have to be thinking about molecules, you know, one by one, not just as this class and many.

    "speech_text": "so. Why do we focus on Hdac Three? and the reason is because, years ago, in the course of a series of studies in my lab, and also around the world. That we're trying to understand how nuclear receptors work, and led to the discovery of the Co, repressors, in particular, Encore and smart, and then. Almost immediately, that's that was the era many in the audience probably remember when we were 1st, starting to realize how important protein protein interactions were. and the first thing people did was to take either pieces of these molecules or the whole molecule and look for potential interactions in things like yeast two hybrid screens, which were extremely valuable, led to some great insights, but also led to a lot of false positives, if you will, and we went very quickly, because these actually are very large molecules, about 2,500 amino acids each, went from a short period of time where there was no clue what they did to having hundreds of molecules they could potentially interact with, And what, Matt Gunther? when he was a graduate student in my laboratory. This is really our lab's version of slugging through how there is how the Co repressor. interacts with the nuclear receptor through these corner peptides, and then the complex, and that's what you'll find in this compendium of papers, but it was really Matt Gunther's work that I'm going to highlight now, and what Matt did was to purify the complex of SMART, one of these two co-repressor proteins from HeLa cells, the endogenous complex, and what he found was a very tight Complex, we refer to as the core complex that contains a number, a couple of interesting molecules, I'm not going to go into in detail, but contained a single histone, deacetylase, and specifically. Histone deacetylase, three in stoichiometric abundance, and we got interested in that because as I've already mentioned, this is a regulator. of epigenomic structure and potentially of gene expression, and the other thing that Matt discovered, which really surprised us because we've been thinking all along, and I think it's largely true, That these docking proteins, the the Co oppressors largely serve as docking proteins that deliver these enzymes and other interesting and important molecules to targeted sites in the genome. It turned out that actually Hdac Three, the polypeptide Hdac Three did not have has intrinsic activity. but you could not see its activity if you purified it from E. coli or from insect cells or made it in retic lysate, You didn't see any enzyme activity unless you incubated it with the co oppressor, and Matt was able to reduce this. To a 90 amino acid segment that contains a so called Sant motif which cognoscenti in the audience probably know what it is, and for everybody else, it doesn't matter. but it's a motif found in a lot of transcription factors, about 50 amino acids. It turns out it's necessary but not sufficient. There's another 35 or so amino acids, So this is about a 90 amino acid peptide, much smaller than the 2500 amino acids in the corepressor, and this 90 amino acids is both necessary and sufficient. Not only for binding Hdac Three, but for imparting, and for activating its catalytic activity, so, in other words, if when we found Hdac three was. H, Deck One was discovered, and then by In Silico and other molecular technologies, H deck 123 etcetera were found by. Because of their",

So we took advantage of this by starting Starting to study what happens if Ncore cannot interact with Hdac Three, this is the work of notably two people in the lab, Takehiro. Taka hero Ishizuka, who did all of the in vitro biochemistry and cell culture work, and then Teresa Allengard. Who courageously knocked in the mutation that Takihiro had found to abrogate the binding activation of H Deck Three? Into C57 Black Six mice, so we could understand the in vivo importance of this protein protein partnership. So what Takehiro found? Was a point mutation in that Sant motif within this domain that we call the deacetylase activating domain? Is sufficient not only to block Hdac three interaction, which I'm not even showing you on this slide. but actually now we're looking here at the histone deacetylase enzyme activity of an immunocomplex containing wild type NCORE And this point mutant expressed at equal amounts in these experiments, not shown here. And you can see that there's almost baseline amounts of Hdac activity suggesting. That not only is this point mutation not binding Hdac three, but that Hdac three is by far the most quantitatively important histone deacetylase. in this complex. So Teresa went ahead and made mice. It was very important for us to do so because the encore null mutation is embryonically lethal, shown by Jeff Rosenfeld's colleague and colleagues. and these mice in the C57 black six background were born in normal Mendelian ratios and they looked completely normal. And what that told us was that since Ncore, as I just told you, is required for life, and so is Hdac Three, as we've shown, and Scott Hebert and Eric Olson have shown. They're all both required That says that it's complicated and that there's other partnerships. E.g. we know that Hdac Three can interact with smart. And we know that Ncor has other domains, and in this experiment it must be that these other domains of Ncor that are conserves across species. Are what are critical for the survival in the mutant mice? The Ncor is expressed at normal levels, but doesn't interact with Hdac three. And that afforded us and Teresa, in particular, the opportunity to ask the question. Really, for the 1st time of, Is there a role of this co repressor complex? Encore, for sure, because this is a mutation at Encore, but here it's even a more specific question. It's the Encore H, Deck Three interaction.",

    "speech_text": "And indeed, she found that there was an effect, and I'm going to just summarize very quickly the highlights at the descriptive level of Teresa's paper, which is shown here. so I can get into more new directions to try to explain some of the earlier phenomenology in circadian biology that I mentioned. Well, what she found in this experiment where she took out the interaction specifically between Ncore and Hdac three? Were changes in biological rhythms as well as glucose and lipid metabolism the biological? The change in the in the biological rhythm was a change in the. Free running period, the behavioral activity, that is the the inherent circadian clock of these these mice. And the reason that we even thought to look at that is because a couple of years before Uli Schibler and his colleagues in Geneva. Had implicated reverb and I, I don't know how well you can see it, but this is a reverb here. This is taken from a review article by Joe Takahashi, That reverb is one of two. I'm not only showing one negative limb in the circadian clock, and very briefly the circadian clock. The transcriptional circadian clock involves a positive. Limb, led by Bmol One, which is a Bhlh protein, forming a heterodimer with Clock and regulating in a positive way the gene expression. Of the of many genes that we think of as being regulated in a circadian matter, in you name the tissue, and especially in suprachisematic nucleus of the hype of. The hypothalamus, but one of the genes that they regulate is reverb, and reverb being a repressor, binds to. The Bmol promoter was something that lay in in my lab had demonstrated, and reverb is perfect for this because. It's a nuclear receptor that we've been studying for for quite some time, and it lacks Ac terminus that again, the nuclear receptor Cognoscenti will know is critical for. Activation of transcription by ligand reverb is lacking that it's a constitutive repressor, but binds Ncor. At Hdac Three, this complex and Lei Yin had shown that not only was Ncor required Hdac Three required, but that the interaction was required. in vitro, and indeed it turned out to be the case in vivo as well. And I won't have time to go into it, but this whole process is stabilized by molecular heme functioning as a ligand for reverb, which has some implications which I'd be happy to talk about from a metabolic point of view, but because of time I'm not going to emphasize that here today. I want to just emphasize that the circadian phenotype of these mice was more or less Explained by the defect in reverb because it could not interact with Ncor and Hdac Three, the changes in glucose and lipid metabolism that we noticed they were hyperketotic. they were actually protected from insulin resistance and hyperglycemia in a high-fat diet. That was a bit harder to explain. We originally focused on adipose tissue partly because our laboratory is largely focused on adipose tissue, but when we did microarray studies and other studies, although they had less adipose tissue, we really found very little change in gene expression in the adipose tissue, whereas in liver we saw some major changes that are, again, summarized here. I'm not going to go into them in detail, But really what I want to do is now focus on how how is this occurring? What is Hdac three doing in liver to affect? hepatic metabolism? And there were a lot of potential targets. The reverbs, as I've just mentioned, because of this, and reverb has other targets, including Involved in glucose and lipid metabolism, etcetera, but also all the other nuclear receptors in principle, and we're particularly interested in the P, p, a r's, l, x r. Thyroid hormone receptor, but any nuclear receptor that can interact with Ncor, or or, or smart, and Hdac three. is a potential here, and there are also a bunch of other transcription factors that have been implicated as potential interactors. So you can think of this as A problem of of of systems biology because you have. the system of this co-oppressor complex that can interact with many different transcription factors, you know, just partially shown here. We have a phenotype that we're ascribing to the complex, and we want to deconvolute it and understand the contributions of individual components and interactors In the hope of understanding, e.g. we do think that the circadian changes are largely through reverb, but maybe we can find that the other changes are through other factors, and therefore. In parts, more specificity, and understand the process",

    "speech_text": "better, so to go about this what we? Decided to do, and this is largely the work of Dan Feng, in the laboratory, graduate student is to determine the cistrome of Hdac three in the liver. Again, all the binding sites of Hdac three in the liver, and this technology, I think is shrewdly well known here. The work of Casey Zhao, with many histone modifying enzymes, Gordon Hager, Who's who's who's, pioneered not only even to the nuclear receptor. chip assays, but also hypersensitivity type assays and so on, which use similar technologies. But for those who have not seen this before, In the beauty of this is, you can look at the endogenous molecules and their endogenous setting with the natural genome of the tissue or cells that you're interested in. Here we're using the mouse liver. And the idea is that you chop up the DNA in one way or the other, you immunoprecipitate it with a specific antibody, and then what many laboratories do is interrogate very specific regions of the genome by something that can be called chromatin IP chip PCR where either semi-quantitatively or quantitatively, using location-specific primers, you interrogate the gene of interest and you basically figure out if your factor was there or not. Well with the advent of deep sequencing, we can now do what's called ChIP-seq. And in this case, instead of doing this biased analysis and looking at the only the sites you're interested in, you can look genome wide. And that's why this is potentially called cistromics. and. this requires, you know, cheap deep sequencing, which is now possible, not as cheap as we like, but it's getting there, and really outstanding bioinformatics. And we've been fortunate to interact on this project with Shirley Liu at the Data Farber Cancer Institute and her colleagues, and in particular. Tao Lu, a postdoc in her group and most of the bioinformatic analysis I'll show you was the work of Tao, okay? Now, I debated including this because it's such a general audience and it's a detail, but I do think it's really important to point out how much, if you're going to get genome-wide data, that's great, but if it's bad genome-wide data, bad data is bad data. And it's very important to be certain before, especially because there's so much time and effort spent in analyzing these data that you're looking at what you think you're looking at. And different ways to think about this, but one of the ways is to say that whatever the signal you're seeing that you want to ascribe to your factor binding shouldn't be there if your factor is not there. And so what we try to do as much as possible, and I'm showing you an example here, Is to confirm the specificity of the chip antibody here what we've done and this is the work of Zheng Sun, who I'll mention in a moment, has we've. made mice that have the HDAC3 allele flocks on both alleles. We can infect or inject these mice with Adeno associated virus cre into their telomere, and it goes into their liver, and that takes out Hdac, three in their liver. We then look at the CHIP Experiment here by chip, Pcr, e.g. at the Bmal gene, and here it cites, that we found by chip Seq, But now were confirming we're truly due to Hdac Three. You can see that the signal. essentially goes away. These are just control, oh, this is not, this has got formatted wrong, but this is insulin, which is not expressed in the liver, there's no binding, but you can see that the signal goes away, and that reassures us that when we, when I tell you there's a signal, it really is because of HDAC3. Okay, so what did Dan find? Well, she did Well, she did her experiment, and the way the chips seek works is that you get a whole bunch of weeds of Dna36 to 40. Base pairs, and here you can see, or bases, and here you can see, she got about 28 million weeds, and then these can be deconvoluted into peaks. and how you call your peaks is very, it depends on how you want to do your bioinformatics and how many false positives and false negatives you're willing to accept, but here what we've done is we've, we accept, we want one read per per million reads, and the height of the peak has to be nine times or more greater than that of the surrounding DNA, so fairly stringent, and even with that, we see about 15,000 peaks of binding of HDAC3. But one thing that we now always ask, and I would suggest people in the audience should always ask, is when did you do the experiment? So I'll tell you, Dan did this experiment at 5 p.m., which is also called ZT10, that's Zeitgeber time 10, ZT0 is when the lights go on in your mouse facility. So this is when the mice are generally not active and not eating. And we picked ZT10 for a reason, and that's because we knew that reverb, nuclear receptor, what we know is recruiting this HDAC3, at least in the context of the circadian clock, is at its highest level at ZT10, and it has this really profound, this is the protein, but the RNA is very similar, has this really dynamic circadian rhythm, and you can see that it's almost gone at 5 a.m. or ZT22. And so, as originally considered in these experiments, the notion was, as I implied earlier, that we would know Know that or imagine, and we'd try to figure out which of the sites of Hdac three binding at this time point were due to reverb and. and then by looking at 5 a.m. where there's no reverb around, we could infer that some of the sites we see here but not here were due to other factors, And by doing similar types of analyses, including knockdowns, and so on, we could start ascribing peaks to matchups between the factor. And the trend and the, and the Co oppressor complex, And as I mentioned, other transcription factors possible as well, but the. The biggest surprise we got out of all the results I'm going to show you in the remainder of my talk. Is that when? Dan did this analysis at 5 a.m., when there's no reverb around, but we still expected to see all those other peaks associated with all those other sites, she basically found almost no specific binding of HDAC3 to the genome. When you looked at it in terms of what those sites were, and this is actually a bigger circle than it should be to scale so that we can all see it, they overlap, but again, it's 100 out of 15,000. Now that's bioinformatic analysis. How can we be sure this is real? 1st of all, it's not because Hdac three is gone at 5amh, There's plenty of Hdac three there, So what Tao did was to. This is a. to put the data in the form of a heat map. What you're looking at Here are all the sites where Hdac Three is bound to the genome at this time of day. All these 15000 sites. and what you're seeing is when it's a color of red or white, there's binding. So this is not surprising, but this is what contributed to this blue circle. And the question is, if we look at these same sites at 5 a.m., you can see that they're either gone or really attenuated quite a bit. If you look at it a different way and you say, okay, I just want to know what the average signal was at the center of these peaks, well, of course, it was very high at 5 p.m., but at 5 a.m.,",

    "speech_text": "would normally be inactive. So I'm not going to take you through that, but that's the conclusion of these two slides. Even though it was surprising to us to see such a great attenuation of the signal at 5 a.m., the most obvious explanation was that reverb was more important than we ever imagined it would be For bringing Hdac three to genes in the liver, To address this, we did the following 1st. We looked bioinformatically. under those 15,000 HDAC3 peaks, and we saw the half site, which we know is the nuclear receptor half site. Secondly, we performed ChIP-seq analysis for reverb, and what we found was a remarkable overlap such that about 90 percent of the HDAC3 binding sites overlapped right on top, and I'll show you in a minute an example of this, right on top of the reverb binding sites. And finally, using reverb knockout mice that we obtained from Bjorn Vennstrom in Stockholm, but then bred to. Ten generations on black, six mice to be comparable with all the other experiments. Basically what we find and what is summarized in this blue box here, but for all sorts of genes, including Bmal. is that we lose the, largely lose the rhythm that we see between 5 p.m. and 5 a.m., suggesting that indeed it is reverb That's recruiting Hdac three to the majority of these sites. Now, what about Ncor, As I've set this up for you, Ncor was in between. And so it took us a while, but we finally got an antibody that could give us a chip that we believe for encore. and what Logan Everett, who's a postdoc in the lab, has done here is performed an analysis where we're looking on the y-axis of the signal of Hdac, Three, and on the X axis, the signal of Ncor, And what is apparent is that this is really very close to the unity line. Suggesting that the binding of encore out of Htac three are really highly correlated. And the sites that we're looking at here are all the reverb binding sites, and what Logan did here was to color code reverb binding by its strength of binding, giving you essentially a third dimension, and so these are the lowest strength sites. These are the highest in green, and then yellow and red are a little less well separated, but we can still see, I think, pretty clear separation there. And what this tells us is that there's a correlation between the binding strength of not only reverb and H deck of egg core and H deck three, but also of of reverb. And I know you have some really outstanding modelers here. We do it ten also, And so we're able to model this data Well. 1st, I want to show you that. these points, in a way, should be taken out because this is where the input was actually greater than the signal, but here's the sophisticated modeling analysis that we were able to perform, Which I think speaks speaks volume. Okay, So what I've shown you so far? So far is that unexpectedly Hdac, Three really had a A. dramatically different recruitment to the genome at 5 p.m. where we saw it on 15,000 sites, and at 5 a.m. where we barely saw it on the genome at all. But now we want to know what it's doing. That's the other part, taking it from integrative biology to integrative physiology. We want to understand the physiological function of this. And to get at this, we first wanted to know a more biochemical question, and that is, is it causing histone Deacetylation and that's an important point, because there's been some question about this. In fact, Keiji Zhao and colleagues here at the Nih. Have shown very elegantly that histone deacetylase is counterintuitively or associated with actively expressed genes, and we actually see the same thing here. They're associated with genes that are on in the cell, but what we think we've uncovered is that that they have to be on because otherwise they couldn't be modulated. Genes that are off continuously don't need to be modulated. And the way we can see that this is actually playing a role is by looking Deeply, through deep sequencing at histone deacetylation, so what Dan did is to perform chip seq for histone, H, Three lysine, nine and I don't. Think you can see it too well, You'll have to afraid, take my word for this, but at Zt22. When there's that's that's remember that's 05:00 a.m. When there's very little reverb at Hdac, three there so and there's more red here. At these Hdac three sites and there's less red here, so there's less histone deacetylation at the time that Hdac three is present. Which fits this notion that Hdac three is causing histone deacetylation, but it's just a correlation. It could be the other round. it could be that. Having less histone deacetylation recruits Hdac three, but thankfully, although cause and effect can be really tough in this particular type of analysis. here we have to our, for our use, the mice in which we take out HDAC3 in the liver. And when Jeng 's son does this, and then provides the samples after a week to Dan Feng, and she looks, And this is just showing you, we take out the Hdac three. And she looks at histone settlation in the knockout at 05:00 p.m. Now it looks like 05:00 a.m. not 05:00 p.m. And I think I'll show you this. It's more dramatically shown here. It's a bit complicated. You have to look at the differences of these curves. But here's 5 P, M, and 05:00 A.m. This difference, but here's you can see that at 05:00 p.m. but the H Tac three knockout is even more histoma settlation. than at 5 a.m. And this, what this tells us is, summarized here in cartoon form, is that at 5 p.m. When reverb is bringing Ncor and Hdac three to these genes, there's less deacetylation than at 05:00 a.m. When they're not there, well, the notion would be. That this is having an effect on transcription, The mediator of most of your karyotic gene expression is Rna Polymerase Two. And I think you can see here that these genes that are bound by Hdac Three at 05:00 p.m. there's much less rna polymerase at 05:00 p.m. And when Hdac three and Reverb are not there, there's more rna polymerase, and that's again summarized here. And then we went back to the bice in which we've knocked out H. stack three in the liver, looked at their gene expression by microarray analysis, or transcriptomics, if you will. And looked at the genes that were either all the genes in the microarray, the genes that were down regulated, which wouldn't be B by derepression, or the genes that are up regulated. And you can see it's only the genes that are up regulated that have this dramatic enrichment for binding sites by H Deck Three So. So that fills in this piece of the puzzle, and taken together, the conclusion is profound in a way that it's the diurnal",

So, just to show you what this looks like on one track in the Ucfc browser, this is our favorite the B Mall gene. This is reverb binding. So the height of the peaks here, they're probably multiple binding sites, but the height of the peak here is proportional to the to the binding strength. or at least it's the number of signals, chip signal we get, and you can see it's there at CT10, not at 5 a.m., not a big surprise because There's only there's hardly any reverb in the cell at 05:00 a.m. But there's plenty of encore. I didn't show you that, but encore is not changed. and yet its recruitment is specific to the reverb site, and it's also only at 5 p.m. And Hdac three, which I did show you, does not change in its amount in its abundance, Is also that this is that dramatic recruitment I was talking about. So here's the B Mol gene, but this is happening at 15000 sites in the genome. Heres what the histone acetylation looks like? It's somewhat complicated because there's a clear, presumably a clearing of more More nucleosome free region here, but you can see the sides have more histone acetylation and there's even more histone acetylation in the center, consistent with the notion that when Hdac three is there. Like, there's less histone acetylation and the pol two being correlating with the lack of histone acetylation. Is actually very valuable because you you might. Think, despite everything I did to try to convince you that these were not artifactual data, that we're just not being able to do chip very well at 05:00 a.m. Maybe you know Dan's a graduate student. Maybe she's just not on her game at 05:00 a.m. like she was at 05:00 p.m. But you can see that it's the same samples and it's another chip. It's another antibody, but it's basically a chip experiment. And you can see there's a signal here and not here. So it's that's not it. It's really a true biological result, okay? so finally, as I alluded to, we want to know what the function of this all is. We're interested in the mechanism. We want to deconvolute this in terms of what factor is recruiting the co-repressor And what the role of histodeocetylation is? And so on? But what's the role in biology, and I've got to eventually link it to lipid metabolism? because I started by telling you that we were going to explain the phenomenon of increased lipogenesis during the night in rodents. Well, the way we got at this was also by a bioinformatic approach. First, we looked at the genes just By from the systromics, bound by both Hdac three and Reverb at 05:00 p.m. And you can see these were largely metabolic processes,",
