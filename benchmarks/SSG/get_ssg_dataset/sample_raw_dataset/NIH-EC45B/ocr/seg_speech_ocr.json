    "speech_text": "Today we have Dr. Angela Cristiano, who will be talking on genetics and immunology of alopecia areata. Angela got her PhD in microbiology and molecular genetics at Rutgers University and did her postdoctoral work at the Department of Dermatology, Thomas Jefferson University. She set her own laboratory as a research assistant professor at Thomas Jefferson and later became an adjunct assistant professor at Rockefeller University. In 1995, she moved to Columbia University, where she was assistant professor, associate professor and is presently. the Richard and Mildred Rodebeck Professor at the Departments of Dermatology and Genetics and Development. She's the director of the Center for Human Genetics and the vice chair for research of the Department of Dermatology. She is also currently the president of the Society of Investigative Dermatology and serves as the deputy editor for the Journal of Investigative Dermatology. Angela's research has focused on understanding the molecular processes that lead to inherited skin and hair disorders in humans. She's made really beautiful findings and seminal findings starting with the discovery of genetic mutations that are associated with blistering skin disorders. She has also pioneered the research in the underlying genetic causes of hair loss and identification of potential therapies for alopecia For alopecia, areata, an autoimmune form of hair loss. She will be presenting this area of their work today and the title of her presentation is Genetics and Immunology of Alopecia Areata. Please join me in welcoming Dr. Angela Cristiano. Thank you so much, Maria, for the beautiful introduction and for the opportunity to be here speaking in this amazing lecture series. So I'm honored to to attend, and it's wonderful to see so many friends and colleagues out here in the audience, as well as some of the people whose work we've followed. For quite some time now, and I hope that I can do justice to acknowledging everyone appropriately along the way, so thank you for having me. I'm going to talk to you today about an autoimmune form of hair loss called alopecia areata that is within the dermatologic diseases, So this falls within the Nyans mission here at Nih. I'm a P. h. D geneticist, so I'm joined in this work by two. Clinical colleagues, Julian Mckay Wiggin, who runs our clinical trials unit in the department at Columbia, and Raphael Kleins, who's an immunologist at. the time that we did this work, was at Columbia University working in other autoimmune diseases and really helped us move",

    "speech_text": "this program into preclinical models and with Julian's help into the clinic. Our work really stems from a registry that was established by NIAMS in about year 2000 or so called the National Alopecia Areata Registry and it was that group of patients that really formed the basis of allowing us to do the genetic studies that I'll talk about today And I'm joined here by my colleagues at the other registry sites. this was founded, and and the home site was at Md. Anderson in Houston. followed by sites at these institutions and at our own at Columbia. So without this important patient registry, a lot of what you're going to hear today Probably would not be able to happen so again. I have a lots of gratitude to thank folks up front for helping us do this. So just to introduce you to the phenotype, so alopecia, Rihanna is a very common autoimmune form of hair loss affecting. about six million people in the United States, roughly one to two percent lifetime risk. It can sometimes start as small patches of hair loss on the scalp, sometimes on the beard in males. It can progress to cover the entire scalp, sometimes occurs in unusual patterns. One thing that we think we know about it is that it preferentially attacks pigmented hair so it spares The white hairs often leaving behind a patch like this, and it can eventually progress to cover. the entire scalp, in which case it's called alopecia totalis, or the entire body hair, in which case it's called alopecia universalis. When it progresses to to that late stage, it tends to be resistant to conventional therapies. When we began this work, there had been 20 or so years of literature in the field describing an autoimmune infiltrate surrounding affected hair follicles in a characteristic pattern that's called a swarm of bees. And for many years, the composition and nature of this swarm of bees wasn't well understood. And so thinking about ways to target this specifically Was still a little bit out of reach, and so the standard of care of treatment for allopuchariata, still today is steroids either injected. Interlesionally into the scalp, or sometimes topical steroids, in children, occasionally oral steroids, but again without knowledge of. the details of this process, it was very difficult over the years to come up with ways to target this. I'll also make one other disclosure at the beginning that my interest in alopecia is personal as well as professional. So the top middle panel here is myself. I developed alopecia areata in 1996, shortly after arriving at Columbia. And this is really what sparked our interest in trying to dissect the genetics of this complex disease. And so let me So, let me tell you a bit about our basic biological context, our problem, and? And that is that, in normal conditions, the hair follicle exists in a state of relative immune privilege where it remains cloaked. In, if you will, guardians of the immune system that keep it from being recognized by immune cells. That's part of its special privilege in the in the. In the site, and so, for reasons we don't yet understand entirely in terms of triggering events, this hair follicle loses that immune privilege and begins to express. Signs of danger, so it upregulates Mhc class one and two other danger signals that begin to recruit in. in this mixed inflammatory infiltrate. Over the years, this has been shown to contain CD4 cells, CD8 cells. But this process, once it begins, sort of becomes a vicious cycle. The hair follicle secretes more and more danger, recruiting again this infiltrate, and it keeps this process going. So even though it's a complex problem model to think about, it also presents opportunity at two levels. One is to think about ways of treating the immune infiltrate and sort of dampening down that response. But the 2nd involves trying to restore this relative immune privilege state of the hair follicle. And so, if we think about interventions, we can potentially think about doing both of those things, both restoring the immune components and also. Not restoring the hair follicle, so when I show you later, some of our treatment work in mice and in humans, I hope that we can come back to this model and. and talk about",

And that was to try and build an unbiased genetic map of alopecia areata for the first time. And, again, this was coming along at the time in history when GWAS studies, genome-wide association studies, were just becoming popular. And so, again, because this is a complex disease involving both genes and environmental triggers, we followed the footsteps of other diseases before us that had really paved the way for using this approach and thinking about ways to use the genetic maps to find potentially new targets that could be used potentially with already FDA-approved drugs and testing those in clinical trials. So This map of functional genomics is borrowed from my colleague at Columbia, Andrea Califano, who I think has done also a great job of helping us to. think about ways to",

    "speech_text": "work from our clinical trials. So the results of our genome-wide association study, this was from about 2,000 or so patients, roughly 1,500 cases, 3,500 controls. This is a very small genome-wide association study, so nowadays you see numbers in some diseases well over 100,000 cases and controls, So this is a very modest size, Genome wide Association study, and simply we take. A few thousand cases compare their Snp markers to a few thousand controls, and we look for areas of the genome where we see skewing or over representation. of certain genetic markers in the cases relative to controls, and when we do that, this red line is statistical significance. Anything that rises above that line suggests to us that there's a locust there that may be contributing to disease. So the Hla is a nice positive control to have for any autoimmune disease, but it, particularly in alopecia areata, there had been many. candidate gene association studies here in the past, and some of these other genes in black are ones that are shared amongst other autoimmune diseases, so again, nice controls that we're hitting upon, some genes that should have interest in the disease. But what every geneticist really wants is the smoking gun, is the gene that that's unique to your disease, that has the one. the greatest potential, usually, of guiding you towards a mechanism that might help understand pathogenesis. And so in our case, this gene, the ULBP3N6 cluster, you can see is the second most significant hit in alopecia, and importantly, it's also unique to alopecia areata, so to date, there are still no other autoimmune diseases that have this gene as a candidate gene, so similar to insulin and diabetes, for example, it's usually the genes that are unique to your disease that are the ones that are the most instructive about pathogenesis. The other reason this gene was exciting is because it happens to be a danger signal. It's a ligand for a receptor called NKG2D that's expressed on activated CD8 effector cells, and when those two engage, the CD8 effectors can then target and kill cells that are expressing this ligand.

These mice develop spontaneous alopecia in about 15 % of females at about a year, and so it's not a very tractable. model to do either prevention or treatment studies waiting around all this time. So John Sundberg and Kevin McElwee at the Jackson Labs developed a graft model where they can take small bits of skin from affected AA mice and graft them onto the back of C3H recipients. And when you do that, after about six weeks, the mice begin to lose hair on the belly first, resembling patchy alopecia areata. And then if you let this progress to three or four months, they'll lose hair everywhere on the back and on the rest of the body. And so this model is very stereotypical. It's easy to use for testing. And so we can do two things with it. We can give drugs at the time of the grafts and we can try to prevent the onset of alopecia. That's the easier model. Or we can let the mice lose their hair, either early or late disease, and then give drug and try to reverse the model and actually set up a treatment-type study. And that's, of course, much more challenging. So I'll show you",

So now that we look back on it, maybe this makes sense, but for a long time in our field, it's been suggested that these patients actually have what they call burned out disease, meaning they're really not treatable because the thinking was that this immune infiltrate had long disappeared from the scalp. But in fact, our biopsy study actually indicates the opposite, that these patients have the highest levels of immune infiltrate signatures. And so this suggests to us that even though for conventional therapies like steroids, these patients were resistant but for the jack inhibitors or others.",

So the same is true for our biomarkers. They worked very well in sort of predicting how these patients would respond. Here we're just a RUXO for comparison in this lane, and after treatment, and here's a TOFA. But the difference here is that this TOFA study was done at four weeks, and so already you can begin to see in four weeks that these patients are beginning to have a molecular response very, very early. So that means if we tested early, we begin to maybe pick up a response signature and know that they would either, A, respond to the drug at all, B, would their dose have to be escalated, or C, if they're not responding, to switch them to something else. And here you just see that we can begin to track this in serum. So this is a four-week treatment looking at CXCL10 in the serum.

So you can see the blue Changing and changing over so that it after twelve weeks begins to look very much like normal scalp, so again, salt scores over time. Again, this was the dose escalation.

Suitable treatments at the moment are even less well understood than alopecia areata, but because of some of the early work from others in the field. Ralph Paus and his colleagues especially have begun to define this early immune infiltrate, suggesting that a jack inhibitor might work here, too, and we have some.

In, involved in both diseases, and so, I'm very gratified that after such a short time, really of this work coming out that. There's been a tremendous uptake of interest on the part of the the pharmaceutical partners to bring these drugs. into studies specifically for alopecia areata, and that really is a change in the way that this disease has been studied in the past. This is the first time, historically, that any of these folks have taken an interest in alopecia for its own sake and not as a second indication for a psoriasis drug, so I'm extremely encouraged by all of this activity. There's interest in topical drugs. There's interest in oral drugs. There's panjax. There's single isoforms.
