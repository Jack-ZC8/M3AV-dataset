However, when we think of technology in dance, the image is less clear than, for instance, the use of technology in painting or in music. The reason is that the tool of expression in dance, which is the abstract movement of the human body, cannot be simply captured in digital formats without losing its essence. Intrigued by this unique challenge, we conducted a systematic review on the literature of dance and choreography in HCI for the past two decades. My name is Qiu Shizhou, and I will present an overview of our findings on behalf of",

We can read the bodily signals through physiological sensors to directly control multimedia stage effects and to provide context for further augmentation of the performance. We can also write to the body through its underlying sensory neural system to alter the felt experience of the dancer. Physical costumes can change the dancer's perception of their own bodies and redefine the possibility of movement. A similar effect can be achieved with visual and acoustic effects, which influence the dancer's lived experience on stage. Recognizing and analyzing the expressive movement qualities has been another direction of the research in dance. Learning from existing frameworks for categorizing",

For instance, neural networks have been used to create virtual body extensions that react to different features in the movement of the dancers. Robotic agents have also been explored extensively, including drones that respond to specific types of movement from human dancers, and autonomous agents that collaboratively improvise with the human dancers. The other perspective in our review is to look at how technology has influenced the creative process of dance in practice.",
